# recipe-finder
A front-end application to find various recipes

# user story
As an end user, I would like to have meal recipes generated by my of my liking along with my movie preference.

# Concept
Picking a meal can be daunting. Whether it's because of limited ingredients, or strict diet requirements. Having a randomly generated recipe can not only give you a better idea of what you would like to go with but can give you the meal you're looking for.

# How to use
For Recipe Preference, you may select your preference of diet type, cuisine type, meal type, or dish type. Then select Generate to have a recipe generated.
For Movie Preference, check the type of movie you're in the mood for and select Search to have a movie randomly picked.
