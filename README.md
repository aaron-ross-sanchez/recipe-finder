# recipe and movie finder
A front-end application to find various recipes

# user story
As an end user, I would like to have meal recipes generated by my of my liking along with my movie preference.

# Concept
Our mission is to provide you suggestions for a perfect evening. First, choose your dinner preferences under the 'Recipe Generator' section. You can include as many specifications as you'd like, but need at least one specification. Next, choose a movie genre that you'd like to watch alongside your meal. Hit the generate button and we'll provide you with your dinner and movie recommendation below! Each movie recommendation will come with a description and TMDB (The Movie Database) user rating. Each recipe recommendation will include ingredients, instructions and URL link with more information. Cheers!
