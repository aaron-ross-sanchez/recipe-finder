# Diner and a Movie
A front-end application to find a recipe and movie recommendation.

# User Story
As an end user, I would like to select my diet/preference specification(s) and receive a recipe recommendation. I'd also like to select my film genre preference(s) and receive a film recommendation.

# Concept
Our mission is to provide you suggestions for a perfect evening. First, choose your dinner preferences under the 'Recipe Generator' section. You can include as many specifications as you'd like, but need at least one specification. Next, choose a movie genre that you'd like to watch alongside your meal. Hit the generate button and we'll provide you with your dinner and movie recommendation below! Each movie recommendation will come with a description and TMDB (The Movie Database) user rating. Each recipe recommendation will include ingredients, instructions and URL link with more information. Cheers!

# How to use
The application is being hosted on GitHub pages here:
https://aaron-ross-sanchez.github.io/recipe-finder/

On startup, the application provides a brief summary of the application along with instructions. In the 'Recipe Preference' section, you can select your food preferences by diet type, cuisine type, meal type and dish type. Hitting the 'Generate' button will provide a recipe recommendation below. This blurb will include the recipe name, ingredients required, cooking instructions, and a URL with more information.
From the 'Moive Preference' section, check the box next to any movie genres that appeal to you. Hit the 'Generate' button and a film recommendation will appear in the bottom-most section. This will include the film poster, a description, and the Movie Database user score.

Hitting the 'Generate' buttons again will show a new recommendation for the respective section.
